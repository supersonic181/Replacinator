# Replacinator
This is python script written by me (not from scratch) to copy any number of pages from two Pdf and create new pdf.

**Q) How it works?**

  Step 1: Keep Replacinator.py file and PDFs in same directory
  
  Step 2: Open Cmd -> Move to Replacinator.py folder by using CD command
  
  Step 3: Run "python replacinator.py"


**Q) Did "I" wrote the script from Scartch?**

  NO, this is modified version of a bugged version of this i found on StackOverFlow. Like they say, "You don't have to know everything, you just have to know where to look for" :p 


**Q) Where did i learn this from?**

  RealPython site has a whole tutorial blog on "How to get started with PDF in Python?", that's where i learnt what to modify and what to remove from the original script.


**Q) Why "I" wrote this script for?**

  To be honest, i was way to lazy to modify the assignments send over by my friends for submission, so i wanted a easy and lazy technic to modify the assignment pdfs, thus the Replacinator :p 

But, you can also use it to replace any amt of pages or any particular page from 2 pdfs or from 1 pdf :D


**Q) Why the name "Replacinator"?**

  Sounds GOOD!
