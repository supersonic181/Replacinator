# Replacinator
This is python script written by me (not from scratch) to replace 1st page of any Pdf with the desired 1st page.

Q) How it works?

  Step 1: Keep Replacinator.py file and PDF folder in same directory
  
  Step 2: Choose the 1st Page and replace with Name_Page.pdf in PDF directory but make sure you keep the name same else you have to change the name in script.
  
  Step 3: Do the same for Source.pdf.
  
  Step 4: Keep any/blank pdf of your name (in my case it's G_58_ShubhamShaw.pdf), you can keep any name but replace the name in script.
  
  Step 5: Open Replacinator.py and Run it. 

Q) Did "I" wrote the script from Scartch?

  NO, this is modified version of a bugged version of this i found on StackOverFlow. Like they say, "You don't have to know everything, you just have ti know where to look for" :p 

Q) Where did i learn this from?

  RealPython site has a whole tutorial blog on "How to get started with PDF in Python?", that's where i learnt what to modify and what not to in the original script.

Q) What "I" wrote this script for?

  To be honest, i was way to lazy to modify the assignments send over by my friends for submission, so i wanted a easy and lazy technic to modify the assignment pdfs, thus the Replacinator :p 

But, you can also use it to replace any amt of pages or any particular page from 2 pdfs or from 1 pdf , just make a minor changes in the code :D

Q) Why the name "Replacinator"?

  Sounds GOOD!
